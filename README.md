# AlmostPomodoroTimer

I  USE: 
1. VIEW BINDING
2. CountDownTimer
3. ActivityResult API
4. Activity Navigation
5. XML

So this app can start a timer which can be set to exact time in settings previously. After time has gone you'll get Alert Dialog which says that you almost completed the task you wanted to complete
or you finally did it! It depends on amount of undone exercices left. There could me 1, 2 or 3 exercices in app. And you can set them in settings as you can set time there.
If you changed the time but didn't change amount of exercices, ones that were already done will still be done. I did it on purpose.

A bit about timer. You can stop, play and restart it. Also main screen have a Total Reset button that will set everything like nothing happens (except for settings change)

It doesn't work when app is inactive yet. But maybe it will be soon.
